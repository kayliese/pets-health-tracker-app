# Pet's Health Tracking App with AWS Amplify Authentication

This is a React Native mobile application that allows pet owners to monitor and track their pet's health and well-being. The app includes features such as tracking daily activities, logging health metrics, taking notes, scheduling appointments, and reading articles and news related to pet health.

## Screens

The app includes four main screens:

### Pets

This screen displays basic information about the pet, including current mood, a picture of the pet, health monitoring, and basic information about the pet. Users can add or delete pets from this screen.

### Profile/Settings

This screen allows users to update their account and user information, as well as send information to their vet or export data via email, Excel or Word. Users can also log out and sign up as new users.

### Activity (Notifications)

This screen displays emergency alerts and updates related to the pet's daily activity, such as water intake, calories burned, steps walked, and hours of sleep. It also includes graphs, recommended goals, and weekly and monthly calendars to track habits.

### Health

This screen allows users to log and track health metrics such as blood pressure, heart rate, bone density, and weight. It includes a little medical information about each metric, such as how it is measured and what it means for a dog's health.

### Notes and Scheduling

This screen allows users to take notes or log information about the dog for that day, including what the dog ate, any weird behaviors or concerns, and other notes. Users can also schedule upcoming appointments, which will be displayed on a calendar.

## Additional Features

In addition to the four main screens, the app includes the following features:

### Articles, News, and Videos

Users can read articles, news, and watch videos related to pet health via API. However, they will not be able to create their own.

### Overview

This feature allows users to view detailed information about the pet, including the dog's breed, height, weight, color, age, health issues, medication, and diet.
